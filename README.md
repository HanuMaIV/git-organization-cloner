# Git Organization Repo Cloner by Brendan Miranda [BrendanMiranda.com](http://www.brendanmiranda.com)

Clone All the repos from your organization by running the parser.rb in the directory that you want your repos to be stored.

** GitHub must be setup with SSH authentication in order for this script to run

** Note that due to Github's limited API you must know the total number of repos  that you will be cloning. This information is easily available on your github's organization page.
